# Hello World React

This is a test app for `pwa-kit-react-sdk`, the purpose of this minimal app is to:

1. demonstrate `pwa-kit-react-sdk` interface and features
2. develop new productizable features for `pwa-kit-react-sdk`

Please do not add features that are not related to `pwa-kit-react-sdk`. For example, do not add new dependencies as we need to demonstrate the minimal list of dependencies required by the `pwa-kit-react-sdk`.

This is not a public availiable template, for now.

## Setup

```bash
npm ci

npm run build

# There is no SDK dev server available yet.
# We just run the node app from the /build folder.
npm start
```

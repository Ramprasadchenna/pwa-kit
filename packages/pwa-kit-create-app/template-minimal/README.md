# PWA Test App

This is a test app for Managed Runtime, mostly for internal use. 

This app has the smallest footprint possible, in order to be able to 
talk about and test the feature-set of Managed Runtime
itself, without being distracted by the complex dependencies of
any app in particular (eg. the Retail React App, which requires
significant setup with Commerce APIs).


## Setup/Run/Deploy

```bash
npm ci
npm start
npm run push
```
